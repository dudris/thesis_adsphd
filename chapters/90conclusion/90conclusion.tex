The nucleus orientation sampling developed here could be used in a more sophisticated model of growing polycrystal to bring further insights. Other possible advancements include construction of the shape factor maps for 3D anisotropy function; coupling of the interface energy to local values of relevant fields, like adsorbent concentration (thus adding another dimension to the shape factor-orientation map) or include another anisotropy functions.
