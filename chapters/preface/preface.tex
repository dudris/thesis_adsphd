\section*{Use of generative AI in this thesis}
The first complete draft of the thesis was written without any AI-generated text, but ChatGPT4 was used for brainstorming about goals of the thesis. In the following drafts, ChatGPT4 was used for improving the flow, grammar and overall comprehensibility. This applies especially to the Abstract and General Conclusion chapters. The section Goals of the thesis was rewritten by ChatGPT4 from a bullet-point list to a fluent text, but the content remained essentially equal (i.e. no ideas were added by the AI). ChatGPT was also used to aid debugging of problems in LaTeX source compilation.

The whole manuscript was reviewed by the author and he takes full responsibility.
